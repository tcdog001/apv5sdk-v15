int64host(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int64host(7)

NAME
       int64host - INT6400 Host Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       int6khost [options] -N file -P file -n file -p file

DESCRIPTION
       The  INT6400  Host  Emulator  waits for VS_HST_ACTION.IND messages from a local device and
       services them as described in the INT6400 Technical Reference Manual. It can  be  used  to
       demonstrate  or verify proper device/host interaction for flash-less devices. This program
       is not production grade and will stop dead - like a bug! - when things go wrong.  Use  the
       Intellon Embedded API for real-time, production-grade applications.

       Host  emulation applies to flash-less device designs where a local host processor provides
       the persistent storage. The local host can provide a wide  range  of  intelligent  storage
       functions  for a device but this program offers one. Options -N and -P name existing files
       that store the factory default runtime firmware and parameters, respectively.  Options  -n
       and -p name scratch files that will store user firmware and parameters, respectively. This
       is similiar to the standard Intellon NVRAM scheme but is not the same.

       To use the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then  start  this
       program  with  the  correct  filenames.  The  program will automatically respond to device
       requests to download memory configuration, firmware and/or parameters and upload  firmware
       or  and/or  parameters under device control. See the Intellon Firmware Technical Reference
       Manual for more information.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -F[F]  Flash  NVRAM  once  downloaded  firmware has started. The same firmware and PIB are
              downloaded, again, using VS_WR_MOD and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding  a
              second  F  here  or  another  -F anywhere on the command line will perform a forced
              flash. When no NVRAM is present, normal and force flash cause the device to  upload
              to  the  host.  When  blank  or  corrupted NVRAM is present, forced flash writes to
              NVRAM. This operation will fail when no NVRAM is present.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Use this file to download firmware when requested by the  local  device.  The  file
              must  exist and have a valid NVM file format or it will be rejected. No assumptions
              are made based on filename and no filename conventions are  enforced.  The  program
              will not over-write this file. This option and argument are required.

       -n filename
              Use  this  file to store firmware uploaded from the local device. The file need not
              exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.  If  firmware  is
              uploaded  to  this  file,  it  is used for subsequent firmware downloads unless the
              device requests a factory reset. In that case, the file specified by option  -N  is
              used.  This  option and argument are optional. If omitted then the default filename
              host.pib will be used.

       -P filename
              Use this file to download parameters when requested by the local device.  The  file
              must  exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be rejected. No assumptions
              are made based on filename and no filename conventions are  enforced.  The  program
              will not over-write this file. This option and argument are required.

       -p filename
              Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device. The file need not
              exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.  Once  parameters
              are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent parameter downloads unless the
              device requests a factory reset. In that case, the file specified by option  -P  is
              used.  This  option and argument are optional. If omitted then the default filename
              host.nvm will be used.

       -q     Suppress status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In  particular,  this  option  will  print
              incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  starts  the  host  emulator. The -C, -N and -P options are always
       required. Their order is not important.

          int64host -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib
