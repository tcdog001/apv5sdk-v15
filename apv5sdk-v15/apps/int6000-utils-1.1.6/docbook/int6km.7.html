int6km(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            int6km(7)

NAME
       int6km - INT6x00 Memory Explorer

SYNOPSIS
       int6km [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Intellon  INT6x00 Memory Explorer reads a region of device memory using one VS_RD_MEM
       message and prints the contents on stdout in either hexadecimal dump  or  binary  register
       format.  A maximum of 1024 bytes may be read at one time. This utility is useful only when
       you know the offset and extent of the data in SDRAM. Of course, the offset  will  probably
       change  from  one firmware release to another. Also, there may be internal restrictions on
       memory offsets that can be read. As of firmware revision 3.1  you  cannot  read  addresses
       below 16M or above 32M.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Display absolute memory offsets in hexadecimal dump format. If omitted  then  rela‐
              tive memory offsets are displayed.

       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -h     Display a brief heading to help users interpret information.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -l length
              The  length  of the memory region to be read in bytes. The value may be specifed as
              either decimal, octal, hexadecimal or binary. Octal values start with 0.  Hexadeci‐
              mal  values  start  with 0x or 0X. Binary values start with 0xb or 0B.  The minimum
              value is 0. The default value is 4. The maximum value is 1024.

       -o offset
              The offset of the memory region to be read in bytes. The offset is a  32-bit  value
              expressed in hexadecimal with an optional &quot;0x&quot; prefix. Although any 32-bit value is
              permitted, the runtime firmware may reject selected offsets  and  return  an  error
              message. The default is 0x00000000.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Display  memory  as a series of binary registers instead of hexadecimal bytes. This
              option rounds offset to a 32-bit boundary and truncates length  to  a  multiple  of
              four  bytes  before  reading  device  memory.  The  ouput  displays absolute memory
              addresses and their endian converted 32-bit binary values.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps  outgoing
              Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program help information on stderr. This option takes precedence over all
              other options on the command line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr. This option takes  precedence  over
              all other options on the command line except help information. Use this option when
              sending screen dumps to Intellon technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may  be  specified.
              If  more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device
              in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for information  about  symbolic
              device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a
       48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower  or  mixed  character  case.
       Octets   may   be   separated  with  colons  for  clarity.  For  example,  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
       &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the  Ethernet  broadcast  address,  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All  devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote
              device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device  is
              any device not manufactured by Intellon.

       local  A  synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.

EXAMPLES
       The following example dumps a region of memory from the local device because  we  did  not
       specify  a  device  address.  The memory offset is 0x00183000 which happens to be the GPIO
       register. The region length is 32 bytes. The memory offset is assumed to be hexadecimal so
       the explicit 0x prefix may be omitted. Observe that the displayed memory offsets are rela‐
       tive, not absolute.

          # int6km -o 00183000 -l 32
          00000000 7F 0F 00 00 00 0A 00 00 F8 0F 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000010 75 10 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 u...............

       The next example does the same thing but displays a one-line header  and  absolute  memory
       addresses because options -h and  -a are present. The optional header help locate specific
       bytes within the region. This is especially useful when the offset is not an even multiple
       of 16 bytes.

          int6km -aho 183000 -l 32
          LOCATION 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F ----------------
          00183000 7F 0F 00 00 00 0A 00 00 F8 0F 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00183010 75 10 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 u...............

       The  first  four bytes of this region are the 32-bit GPIO register where each of the first
       12 bits correspond to a GPIO pin on the device. It is  difficult  to  interpret  the  bits
       because bytes appear in little endian order.

       The  next  example  displays  the same information in register format because option -r is
       present. The offset is rounded to an even 32-bit boundary and the length is  truncated  to
       an even multiple of 4 bytes before the region is read. This ensures that we are reading on
       a register boundary. The contents of each register are endian converted and  displayed  in
       binary as 4 bytes. The optional header helps locate specific bits within each register.

       Notice  that the memory content shown in this example is different than that shown in pre‐
       vious ones. This is normal when reading registers because their content is often  dynamic.
